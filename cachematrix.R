# Theses two functions help the user cache computations that would 
#normally take more time than ususal to calculate. This usually works
# with very long vectors, so these two functions can cache the value 
# of the matrix then later solve it.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
